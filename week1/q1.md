## 1. Review in C++ and test the following algorithms from the lecture:

### Counter_clockwise

We're using a formula to check if something is counter-clockwise.

- if negative -> clockwise
- if positive -> counter-clockwise

### Intersect for line segment intersection

???

### Closed simple path

Algorithm:

- Choose one point as starting point
- For each other point compute the angle made by drawing a line from the point to the starting poing and then out in the positive horizontal direction.
- Sort the points according to the angle.
- Connect adjacent points in the sorted list.

### Point in polygon

???
